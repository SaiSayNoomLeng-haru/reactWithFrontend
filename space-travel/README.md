**Self Notes**
- React Custom hooks
- React Code Splitting (react.lazy) => React.lazy() is specially designed for code-splitting of react components, it doesn't handle API data fetching directly.
- React useMemo() is for remembering calculated values between renders and it shouldn't be used with custom hooks as they are supposed to be at top level of functional components.
- Try to refactor codes for shorter and lighter version and readability and maintainence.
