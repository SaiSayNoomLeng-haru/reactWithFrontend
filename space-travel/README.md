- tablet(560px)
- desktop(1440px)

**Tasks**
- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

**Built With**
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox, Grid
- ReactJS
- React Router 6
- JS

**Self Notes**
- React Custom hooks
- React Code Splitting (react.lazy) => React.lazy() is specially designed for code-splitting of react components, it doesn't handle API data fetching directly.
- React useMemo() is for remembering calculated values between renders and it shouldn't be used with custom hooks as they are supposed to be at top level of functional components.
- Try to refactor codes for shorter and lighter version and readability and maintainence.
